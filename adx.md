# Connect Azure Data Explorer to the Reference Solution

> [!NOTE]
> This article is part of the **OPC UA Reference Solution**, which uses **IEC 62541 standard OPC UA PubSub** to send telemetry data from the edge to the cloud. It is **different** from the default configuration of Azure IoT Operations, which is described at [**Azure IoT Operations Overview**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-operations/overview-iot-operations#architecture-overview), where an edge data flow sends telemetry data to the cloud over the endpoint's native protocol. Therefore, OPC UA PubSub is **not required** between Azure IoT Operations and cloud endpoints.

## Automated deployment

Select the **Deploy** button to deploy all required resources to your Azure subscription:

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdigitaltwinconsortium%2FManufacturingOntologies%2Fmain%2FDeployment%2Farm.json)

The deployment process prompts you to provide a password for the virtual machine (VM) that hosts the production line simulation and the Edge infrastructure.

To reduce cost, the deployment creates a single Linux VM for both the production line simulation and the edge infrastructure. In a production scenario, the production line simulation isn't required.

## Use cases for condition monitoring, OEE calculation, anomaly detection, and predictions in Azure Data Explorer

You can deploy a [sample dashboard](https://github.com/digitaltwinconsortium/ManufacturingOntologies/blob/main/Tools/ADXQueries/dashboard-ontologies.json). To learn how to deploy a dashboard, see [Visualize data with Azure Data Explorer dashboards &gt; create from file](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/azure-data-explorer-dashboards#to-create-new-dashboard-from-a-file). After you import the dashboard, update its data source. Specify the HTTPS endpoint of your Azure Data Explorer server cluster in the top-right corner of the dashboard. The HTTPS endpoint looks like: `https://<ADXInstanceName>.<AzureRegion>.kusto.windows.net/`.

To display the OEE for a specific shift, select **Custom Time Range** in the **Time Range** drop-down in the top-left corner of the Azure Data Explorer Dashboard and enter the date and time from start to end of the shift you're interested in.

## Render the built-in Unified NameSpace (UNS) and ISA-95 model graph in Kusto Explorer

This solution implements a Unified Namespace (UNS), based on the OPC UA metadata sent to the Azure Data Explorer time-series database in the cloud. This OPC UA metadata includes the ISA-95 asset hierarchy. You can visualize the resulting graph in the [Kusto Explorer tool](/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/tools/kusto-explorer).

Add a new connection to your Azure Data Explorer instance and then run the following query in Kusto Explorer:

```kql
let edges = opcua_metadata_lkv
| project source = DisplayName, target = Workcell
| join kind=fullouter (opcua_metadata_lkv
    | project source = Workcell, target = Line) on source
    | join kind=fullouter (opcua_metadata_lkv
        | project source = Line, target = Area) on source
        | join kind=fullouter (opcua_metadata_lkv
            | project source = Area, target = Site) on source
            | join kind=fullouter (opcua_metadata_lkv
                | project source = Site, target = Enterprise) on source
                | project source = coalesce(source, source1, source2, source3, source4), target = coalesce(target, target1, target2, target3, target4);
let nodes = opcua_metadata_lkv;
edges | make-graph source --> target with nodes on DisplayName
```

For best results, change the `Layout` option to `Grouped`.
